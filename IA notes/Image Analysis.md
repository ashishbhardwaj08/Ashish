## Unit -1 : Morphological Image Processing
Basic concept of set theory, logic operation involving binary images, [[Dilation & Erosion]], [[Opening]] and [[Closing]], and [[Hit-or-Miss]] transformation. Some basic morphological algorithms – [[Boundary extraction]], region filling, extraction of connected components, convex hull, thinning, thickening, skeletons, and pruning. Extensions to gray-scale images – Dilation, Erosion, Opening and closing, and application of gray scale morphology.
## Unit - 2:  Image Segmentation
Detection of discontinuities – Point detection, line detection, edge detection – gradient operators, compass operators, Laplace operators and zero crossing, stochastic gradients, performance of edge detector operators. Amplitude thresholding or window slicing, component labeling, boundary based approaches, region-based approaches and clustering, template matching, and texture segmentation.
## Unit - 3: Boundary Extraction and Representation
Connectivity, Contour following, edge linking, Hough transform, chain code, fitting line segments, B-spline representation, Fourier descriptors, shape number, and autoregressive model.
## Unit - 4: Region Representation
Region Representation: Run-length codes, quad-trees, topological descriptor, texture and projections.
## Unit - 5: Moment Representation
Moment representation theorem, moment matching, orthogonal moments, moment invariants, applications of moment invariants.
## Unit - 6: Shape feature
Geometric features, moment-based features.
## Unit - 7: Texture
Statistical approaches, structural approaches, and other approaches.
## Unit - 8: Scene matching
Image subtraction, template matching and area correlation, and matched filtering.
## Unit - 9: Object recognition and image understanding
